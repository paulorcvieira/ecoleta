# O que Ã© a Next Level Week?
It is a project of teaching programming through the internet, carried out by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
In one week, livestreams are made, access to an event community and video content
about web development, using tools from front to back end to build a common project. The content is separated into two different tracks:

*Starter* | *Booster*
----------|----------
Made for newbies developers, the project consists of a complete website, from front to back end, with presentation of languages â€‹â€‹and tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js. | Made for more experienced developers, the project consists of a complete application, web and mobile, using tools such as React.js, ReactNative, TypeScript, etc..

<br/>

This repository was made during NLW # 1, which took place from June 1 to 7, 2020, *#Starter*.
